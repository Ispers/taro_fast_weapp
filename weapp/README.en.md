#### Frequently Asked Questions
During the installation of dependencies, a dependency conflict occurred due to inconsistent versions of the React Native dependency, resulting in the inability to install
Solution:
```
# If there is no React Native requirement, simply ignore the mandatory installation
pnpm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
